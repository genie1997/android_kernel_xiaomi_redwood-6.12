/*
 * Generic hot-plug detection configuration structure for dynamic display interfaces.
 *
 * This structure provides comprehensive configuration details for newly connected devices
 * on interfaces that support dynamic connection changes. It serves as a unified interface
 * for various display connection types including DisplayPort, USB-C, and other pluggable
 * display technologies.
 *
 * The structure is designed to be interface-agnostic while providing specific context
 * through its field values. Different interface types interpret the fields according
 * to their specific requirements and capabilities.
 *
 * Usage Examples:
 *   - DisplayPort (DP): @orientation indicates CC1/CC2 for USB-C connectors,
 *     @pin_config maps to DP pin assignments A-F, @hpd_irq indicates HPD IRQ events.
 *   - USB-C Alt Mode: @orientation specifies connector orientation,
 *     @pin_config defines lane configuration and capabilities.
 *
 * @orientation:
 *     Cable orientation or connector role identifier.
 *     - For USB-C/DP: CC1 (0) or CC2 (1) orientation
 *     - For other interfaces: connector-specific orientation value
 *     - Range: Interface-dependent, typically 0-1 for USB-C
 * @port_index:
 *     Physical port identifier for the display interface.
 *     - Identifies which physical port/connector the device is connected to
 *     - Used for multi-port systems to distinguish between different connectors
 *     - Range: 0 to (max_ports - 1), where max_ports is system-dependent
 * @pin_config:
 *     Connector pin configuration or lane mapping specification.
 *     - For DP: Pin assignment configuration (A, B, C, D, E, F)
 *     - For USB-C: Alt mode pin assignment and lane allocation
 *     - Defines how data lanes are allocated between USB and display functions
 *     - Range: Interface-specific enumerated values
 * @hpd_state:
 *     Current hot-plug detection state of the interface connection.
 *     - Indicates whether a device is currently connected or disconnected
 *     - Values: 0 = disconnected, 1 = connected
 *     - Updated whenever connection state changes
 * @hpd_irq:
 *     Hot-plug detection interrupt or attention signal indicator.
 *     - Signals interrupt or attention events from the connected device
 *     - For DP: Indicates HPD IRQ pulse (short pulse vs. long pulse)
 *     - Used to trigger EDID re-read, capability negotiation, or link training
 *     - Values: 0 = no IRQ, 1 = IRQ/attention signal present
